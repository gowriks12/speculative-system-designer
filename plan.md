Start with data/futures.json

Before you open main.py, confirm:

 Futures are explicit, pessimistic, and uncomfortable

 Roots are actually restrictive

 Server can say “no”

 Client cannot bypass server judgment

 Tradeoffs are persisted as artifacts


# Prompts that encode authority and judgment belong to the MCP server.
# Prompts that encode creativity and synthesis belong to the client.

# “Before I wrote any code, I wrote down the futures I was afraid of and the constraints I wasn’t willing to violate. Everything else in the system exists to enforce those two ideas.”

Next Steps 
    - [DONE] create a full orchestration tool that calls every other tool and orchestrates everything without needing a client
    - stdio way of starting server
    - Download claude desktop
    - Integrate with claude desktop
    - Majorly two different tools in the server {generate architecture with root contraints} {Evaluate the architecture with simulated futures and generates }
