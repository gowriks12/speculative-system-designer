Start with data/futures.json

Before you open main.py, confirm:

 Futures are explicit, pessimistic, and uncomfortable

 Roots are actually restrictive

 Server can say “no”

 Client cannot bypass server judgment

 Tradeoffs are persisted as artifacts


# Prompts that encode authority and judgment belong to the MCP server.
# Prompts that encode creativity and synthesis belong to the client.

# “Before I wrote any code, I wrote down the futures I was afraid of and the constraints I wasn’t willing to violate. Everything else in the system exists to enforce those two ideas.”
