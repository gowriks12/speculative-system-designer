# Concert Ticketing Platform — Simulated Future: Regulatory Compliance

## Scenario Overview
As the platform expands to new markets (EU, UK, potentially global), it encounters a web of regulatory requirements: data privacy laws, consumer protection rules for ticketing, financial regulations for resale payouts, and accessibility mandates. Non-compliance risks fines, market bans, and reputational damage.

---

## Regulatory Domains & Architecture Impact

### 1. Data Privacy — GDPR (EU) / UK GDPR / CCPA (California)

**Requirements:**
- Lawful basis for processing personal data
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Data portability (export user data on request)
- Consent management for marketing communications
- Data breach notification within 72 hours (GDPR)

**Architecture Changes:**
- **Consent Management Platform (CMP):** Integrate OneTrust or Cookiebot for cookie consent + marketing opt-ins
- **Data Retention Policies:** Automated purge jobs — delete inactive user PII after retention window (e.g., 3 years post last transaction)
- **Soft Delete + Anonymization:** User deletion anonymizes records rather than hard-deleting (preserves financial audit trail)
- **Data Export API:** Self-service endpoint allowing users to download all their data (JSON/CSV)
- **Data Residency:** PostgreSQL deployments in EU region for EU users; US region for US users — enforced at API Gateway routing layer
- **DPA Agreements:** Ensure all third-party processors (Stripe, SendGrid, Auth0) have signed Data Processing Agreements

### 2. Ticketing Consumer Protection Laws

**Requirements (varies by region):**
- UK: **Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act** — resale price caps (face value + fees) for certain venues
- EU: Some member states restrict resale markups
- US: State-level anti-scalping laws (e.g., New York, New Jersey)
- General: Transparent fee disclosure before checkout ("all-in pricing")

**Architecture Changes:**
- **Pricing Rules Engine:** Configurable per-event, per-region resale price cap enforcement in Resale Service
- **Fee Transparency Layer:** Checkout UI must display full breakdown (ticket price + service fee + delivery fee) before payment confirmation — enforce in frontend Order Summary component
- **Refund Policy Engine:** Support event-cancellation auto-refunds per regional requirements; configurable per organizer with regulatory floor
- **Audit Trail:** Immutable log of all price changes and transaction terms for regulatory inspection

### 3. Financial Regulations — Payments & Payouts

**Requirements:**
- **PCI-DSS:** Already handled via Stripe; maintain SAQ-A compliance
- **KYC/AML:** Sellers receiving above threshold payouts (e.g., €1,000/year in EU) require identity verification under anti-money laundering rules
- **Tax Reporting:** US sellers above IRS thresholds require 1099-K generation; EU sellers may require VAT handling

**Architecture Changes:**
- **KYC Service:** Stripe Identity integration for seller verification; block payouts until verified above threshold
- **Tax Calculation Service:** Integrate Avalara or TaxJar for jurisdiction-aware tax calculation at checkout
- **1099-K / VAT Reporting:** Annual batch job generating tax reports from Order Service data; export to accounting systems
- **Payout Ledger:** Immutable double-entry ledger for all financial movements (seller earnings, platform fees, refunds)

### 4. Accessibility — WCAG 2.1 AA

**Requirements:**
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines compliance for public-facing pages
- Keyboard navigability, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast

**Architecture Changes:**
- **Frontend audit:** Automated accessibility testing in CI pipeline (axe-core / Lighthouse CI)
- **Seat Map Accessibility:** Text-based seat selection fallback for screen readers alongside visual seat map
- **Alt text pipeline:** Require alt text for all event images uploaded by organizers (enforced at upload)

## Recommended Governance Actions
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) before EU launch
- Conduct annual PCI-DSS self-assessment and third-party penetration test
- Maintain a Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) document
- Build a regulatory change monitoring process — ticketing laws evolve frequently
